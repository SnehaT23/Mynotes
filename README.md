# Day1
welcome to my repository 
# Day2
I learned how to download Kali Linux for VirtualBox and use 7-Zip to extract the files. While extracting Kali Linux using 7-Zip, I faced some errors but was able to fix them successfully. I'm eager to keep learning new things.
# Day3
Learned about Linux commands such as:
→ ls (List files and directories)
→ cd (Change directory)
→ pwd (Print current working directory)
→ mkdir (Create a new directory)
→ chmod (Change file permissions), etc.
Also learned how to run and execute them in Kali Linux using VirtualBox.
I'm excited to learn more new things ahead!
